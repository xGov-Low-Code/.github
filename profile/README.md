## 2. Prerequisites

- Create a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don't already have one.
- Optional: Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) on your computer if you want to use the command line. (You can also upload files via the website.)

2. Click the **+** sign in the top right corner and select **"New repository"**.
3. Fill in the repository name, description, and choose if it should be public or private.
